This is a project created by SentientPlatypus (Geneustace Wicaksono) and Zeros0-0 (Jayden Tse) 


So far we have two solutions. 

1. COCO-classes with hand landmark detection.
This solution will trigger a warning if your hands get close enough to your phone.


2. custom YOLOv8 model
This solution detects hands on phones itself.


Neither of these solutions have been able to detect through a windshield yet. Perhaps we need to reduce the glare on the windshield by using a polarizing filter on the camera.
